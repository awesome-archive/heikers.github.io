[heikers.com](https://www.heikers.com) is yet another way to read hacker news (news.ycombinator.com):
* Read top stories for the past day or week
* A convenient side bar to access your own submissions and top "show HN"
* An entirely static site (updates periodically throughout the day), served from Github pages
* More to come

# Acknowledgement
* We thank https://github.com/livid/v2ex for the UI design.
